18,2024-09-04 04:26:40,0,"Basically you just need to get to ORD (and fly to Newark from there). You’ve got three options for that

First, you can take a bus. Peoria Charter is a good option because they have service to ORD from three stops in CU every two hours or so (and more on busy travel days like school breaks). It’ll take around 3.5-4 hours to get to ORD and tickets around $40-$50 each way

You could also take the train, but it’s a bit more complicated, as Amtrak’s routes from Champaign to Chicago will end up you at Union Station in downtown. From there you’ll need to take the CTA blue line to the airport. It’s around a 2.5-3 hour train ride plus about 45 minutes on the CTA line. Amtrak tickets are much cheaper though, as they only cost around $15 if you book in advance (plus another $5 for the CTA ticket to the airport). You also have more limited timing options, as there are only 3 trains per day from Champaign to Chicago

Lastly, you could fly. There are two flights a day from Champaign to ORD, on American (but they’re operated by Envoy Air if that matters to you). Then you just take a connecting flight to EWR.

Im a former engineer alum, and i worked for the grainger library once upon a time.

My comment is not a slight against you nor engineers at uiuc, rather it was commentary on the pressure that the engineering *college* places on its students such that they are disproportionately more likely to kill themselves. So much more likely infact, that the college's policy has been to lock access to upper floors of nearly every building on the engineering campus due to safety concerns (i'd know as i worked in one such building). However, there are no such safety concerns among the most liberal arts buildings, as the rates of mental health crises are measurably lower among liberal arts students, which is reflected in the data, and thus rooftop access is not only permissible, but is often public access and often encouraged.

But what do i know; maybe thats just a high-minded analysis that the liberal arts college filled my head with that cant be translated into a Natural Language for your brain process, because clearly you couldnt read between the lines and understand that my comment had nothing to do with you, but rather the school ecosystem. 

As i said, engineers havent changed; not in the toxic academic environment they create both in-class, out-of-class and online, nor in their arrogance in assuming every conversation revolves around them, nor in their inability to perceive real societal issues that can't be expressed in formulas.

I don’t know that the majority of people are this way, but the ones that are can be very difficult to change because as someone else mentioned, staff jobs are very secure and even if someone is hearing the negative feedback there aren’t many consequences that can be used to encourage them to rethink their approach if they don’t want to. 

However with most people, they aren’t actually evil or even ill intentioned, just perhaps feeling overburdened and under appreciated and taking out those feelings in non constructive or hurtful ways. If there are admin you will have to work with regularly, I encourage you to just keep things polite and a bit friendly, consistently hold up your end of interactions, and then calmly keep asking for what you need.

The thing with me and design is that I can imagine it, even with great detail, but I can't put it to paper. I can draw structures and replicate, but that's like it. Actual creative thinking? I mentally cannot. Maybe if I tried hard enough, but then I also heard that ROI for architecture is in the dumps so it wouldn't really be worth all the mental stress

I'm gonna visit the FAA office and ask if the structural licensing exam applies to arch. It sounds really interesting. Thanks for bringing it up

And construction? Love it! The course outline for Arch studies seems a lot more design-based than what they advertise, which is a bit sad. The only structural/technical courses you would take are during your Sophomore year. The two years after that? Design studios. Arch studies at UIUC used to be Arch Engineering. Idk why they changed it.

I heard directly from TAs that physics and calc classes are usually the ""weeding"" classes to see who can really succeed. Honestly... it might get me too lol

And it sounds like you've got a solid plan! From what I saw, UIUC has top ranking for Structural eng if you wanna go there again

243,2024-09-03 15:15:40,2,"Tailgate. It's college football. Students tend not to tailgate because its expensive as a student if your parents aren't paying, but as adults with adult income, all of you chipping in some money to tailgate shouldn't be much of an issue. In reality, it probably costs a similar amount of money to send bars vs tailgate, but students are much happier spending that money purely on booze than on a tailgating setup lol. 

Parking is $25 day of (might be $20 if you prepay, but I've never done it so idk how it works). If you have multiple cars, I recommend finding a random university lot with meters a ways away from the stadium and parking any additional cars there (most metered university lots are free on weekends) and taking a bus back to the stadium for free. That way you only pay for the one car and can just pay $5 per guy for parking. 

As far as places to go, Green Street is great for students, but options are more limited for adults (most adults don't want to go to a club-esque college bar and eat drunk student food after a game lol). The best options tho are likely Legends and Murphy's. They're both bars with food, and bar wise, much closer to a true bar while places like Kams or Lion are trying imitate more of nightclub vibes. Off campus tends to be where most people go out of college, specifically going to downtown Champaign. This is where the majority of good local resteraunts are at.

It's also free for seniors and has last-mile services for folks with accessibility issues (which Veo and similar pay services actually don't - because they're largely unusable for seniors, people with balance issues, etc.). 

As for your last paragraph - that's a straw man argument. If you have some actual data about the topic post it. Otherwise you're just making things up in a way that bolsters your argument disingenuously. Comparing a bus to an ebike would of course be ludicrous, but how about lifetime cost per user-trip for an MTD bus vs an equivalent number of user-trips for an escooter?

I met my friends through a combination of classes, RSOs, and dining hall. If you haven’t joined RSOs, join a few. I’ve made some genuinely good friends from them. Besides that, talk to people in class. Try and find someone to sit with in lecture. Especially discussion, sit at the same table every time and you’ll make friends with the people around you.

I would also randomly go up to people in the dining hall and ask to sit with them - it’s actually how I met my roommate

One other thing to remember is that deep friendships take time to form. Despite how it may seem right now, literally every freshman’s friends are all surface level friendships. You’re not gonna become best friends with someone overnight, that will take 1-2 semesters to do (probably more, this is at the bare minimum, if you’re lucky).

899,2024-08-31 23:44:09,0,"**tl;dr: Don't do that.  Just pick one.**

The CS department—excuse me, the *Siebel School for Computing and Data Science*—gets more than 2000 applications a year for *each* of our graduate programs.  It's unlikely that anyone would notice if you applied to one program, *got rejected*, and then applied for another, but in principle, that information is visible to the admissions committee and CS faculty who know where to look.

I'm not certain what would happen in if you were *accepted* for spring admission to MCS and then applied for MSCS admission in the fall, but **my best guess is that your MSCS application would be automatically rejected**.

You are definitely not allowed to apply to more than one CS graduate program *at the same time.*  If you did submit simultaneous MCS and MSCS applications,  your MSCS application would be automatically rejected, and possibly your MCS applciation as well.  Similarly, if you already have a master's degree in CS or a nearby field, you can't be admitted to another master's degree program in CS.

But like I said, I'm not certain whether your plan is allowed.  You really should ask someone in the [CS graduate advising office](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/academics/graduate/graduate-forms-advising-resources/graduate-advising-contacts).  Don't just take my pessimistic word for it!

Regardless of what they tell you, my recommentation is that you decide which master's degree you actually want, *and then apply only to that one*; don't waste your time, or the admissions committee's time, by applying to both.

* If you want to do reserach, apply for MSCS (but remember that you won't be admitted unless at least one professor declares that they're willing to be your advisor).
* If you don't want to do research (or you can't identify a likely advisor) then apply for MCS.

Either way, you should simultaneously apply to similar programs at half a dozen other universities, so that all your eggs aren't in one basket.

To answer your final question: Yes, applications to MCS and MSCS both require three recommendation letters, a statement of purpose, and a complete set of transcripts.  Admission to the MCS program is based primarily on grades, as long as you have a decent computer science background.  Admission to the MS program requires some evidence of research potential to be visible in your statement and your rec letters.",jeffgerickson,1,tldr dont do that just pick one the cs departmentexcuse me the siebel school for computing and data sciencegets more than  applications a year for each of our graduate programs its unlikely that anyone would notice if you applied to one program got rejected and then applied for another but in principle that information is visible to the admissions committee and cs faculty who know where to look im not certain what would happen in if you were accepted for spring admission to mcs and then applied for mscs admission in the fall but my best guess is that your mscs application would be automatically rejected you are definitely not allowed to apply to more than one cs graduate program at the same time if you did submit simultaneous mcs and mscs applications your mscs application would be automatically rejected and possibly your mcs applciation as well similarly if you already have a masters degree in cs or a nearby field you cant be admitted to another masters degree program in cs but like i said im not certain whether your plan is allowed you really should ask someone in the cs graduate advising officehttpssiebelschoolillinoiseduacademicsgraduategraduateformsadvisingresourcesgraduateadvisingcontacts dont just take my pessimistic word for it regardless of what they tell you my recommentation is that you decide which masters degree you actually want and then apply only to that one dont waste your time or the admissions committees time by applying to both  if you want to do reserach apply for mscs but remember that you wont be admitted unless at least one professor declares that theyre willing to be your advisor  if you dont want to do research or you cant identify a likely advisor then apply for mcs either way you should simultaneously apply to similar programs at half a dozen other universities so that all your eggs arent in one basket to answer your final question yes applications to mcs and mscs both require three recommendation letters a statement of purpose and a complete set of transcripts admission to the mcs program is based primarily on grades as long as you have a decent computer science background admission to the ms program requires some evidence of research potential to be visible in your statement and your rec letters,NEU,0.8698400855064392

Go to the library and find books outside what you are assigned that peak your interest. While you don’t have a ton of time for this it can really help broaden your understanding of your field. You will have more resources available to you here than almost anytime in your life and most don’t take advantage of it.

Outside of academics, that last point still stands. Your college years are some of the best for your own self discovery and development. Try as many different things as you can at least once. Don’t think you would like something? Well you never know until you try! If a friend mentions they are part of a club, be curious - ask what it is about and if you can tag along and see. You might find right away that the activity isn’t really for you and that is great to know! You might also find something that sparks a lifelong passion in you, but you never would have found it if you didn’t try.

All three of my kids got the cleaning, painting and carpet cleaning charges and my wife and I with the kids spent 2 days cleaning and the apts were spotless and we have pictures to prove. 

The point I would like to make here is our contracts had Urbana municipal code quoted in them (even though our apts were in Champaign) that we had to sign/initial and in section 12.5 towards the end it clearly states that unless there were damages above and beyond normal wear…the security deposit CANNOT be used for regular cleaning, painting and carpet cleaning. 

And…if there are damages found, that the lessor/landlord must provide written proof of these damages/repairs to lessee within 30 days of move out date.

Ironically, our contracts also state and we had to sign that we would not be party to a class action/group lawsuit.

Diff of course is that in a bathroom you have few stalls, but in a classroom there are many non-accessible seats to take and leave those available.

1323,2024-08-30 09:20:44,49,"General advice for bats in your house (I’ve had this happen in my house in Urbana twice in the last 10 years). 

If it is flying around inside, quickly open an exterior door or window. The bat wants to get outside and is flying around trying to find an exit. They can sense the outside air and will leave. 

Bats cannot fly for very long. They will land on a vertical surface like drapery or blinds. In both instances in my home they were brown bats and they clung to a dark brown fabric strip on the blinds. They can be very hard to spot. 

Most likely the bat is still in your apartment unless there was an open door or window. They don’t seem very good at returning through the small entrances they used to get into the house. 

Bats are dangerous because of rabies. You can contract rabies even through minor contact with a bat (a scratch is sufficient, doesn’t have to be a bite). Untreated rabies in humans is nearly always fatal. You may want to go to student health services just in case. 

So, this is a serious situation. You need to have someone come to your apartment and find the bat and how it got in. Even if you toss it out, it may try to regain access via the same method it originally entered (if the bats are nesting in an attic or crawl space adjacent to your apartment).

The bus service is a great go-to in a pinch, and can either give you directions or possibly take you partway there.  They run all day and night.  Be aware they only stop on the side of the street of the sign, so if you miss one on the other side, wait a few minutes and one will be rolling up to your side. 

If you’re on campus and near an open university office or admin building, those are also a halfway decent option, so long as you can find a faculty or staff member. 

Gambling on the kindness of random strangers, especially if you are a woman, is extremely risky sober, much less inebriated.  

As far as police in this scenario go, only approach marked and obvious vehicles or officers.  I say this because of what happened to Yingying Zhang, who was lost and running late before a guy claiming to be an off duty cop offered her a ride.

Don’t be afraid to call the campus police non-emergency number either:  (217) 333-1216

Just to give more info on SafeRides as someone else mentioned, here's the link to MTD's website with a page specifically about SafeRides (if you don't want to click a link you can find the page by searching ""UIUC SafeRide"" in your browser): https://mtd.org/maps-and-schedules/uiuc-learn-to-ride/saferides/




SafeRides are available OVERNIGHT even during times when the standard bus routes aren't active, and are available until 6am during the fall and spring semesters. **There is no charge, you just show your iCard.** There are some limitations, such as SafeRides not being available far outside of standard bus route limits and not being available to pick up someone directly from a bar, but essentially if you can get to a bus stop or 24-hour university building or something within the specifications listed on the web page, they will pick you up.




UIUC also has SafeWalks available until 2:30am during the semester (search in your browser for ""UIUC SafeWalk"" if you don't want to click this link: https://police.illinois.edu/services/safewalks/); again **there is no charge** for this either, they'll send (I think 2, but I'm not sure) student patrol officers to walk with you to wherever you need to go. Student patrol officers aren't police, although they can contact the police directly if something concerning or dangerous happens (i.e. if you're being followed and threatened).




It would also be good to memorize a couple of UIUC buildings that are open 24 hours a day, so if you need to get into a public space with people around quickly you have options. Grainger is usually open 24 hours a day on weekdays during regular semesters, you just need your iCard (I think your ID in the Illinois App would also be accepted) to enter the building after 10pm, and there's Internet service and public computers there that you can use to contact someone to help you get home.

The carpet cleaning is going to be hard to get around. Unless you have a receipt for getting it professionally cleaned or something. Lots of leases have some kind of clause about getting the carpet professionally cleaned after a lease. You may want to check your lease paperwork for anything like this.

The painting, you can dispute. Inform them the you believe the walls were left with no damage beyond normal wear and tear, and that you should not be held accountable to cover that cost.

You can question the cleaning costs, and there's a decent chance to get a partial refund. If you took pictures of your apartment as you left it, you've got more leverage to work with.

Sadly, Ugroup does something like this with many students in Champaign (Urbana has better tenant's rights). It'll take a couple emails, including reminders, but you should get some money back if you dispute the charge soon.

I admit, going out and meeting people is really hard - especially since 95% of the people you’ll meet are folks you’ll never talk to again, but I can also promise you that it does get easier over time! Quad Day and my classes have really helped me get in touch with other people on campus, and whenever you feel alone I’d definitely suggest delving deeper into your hobbies or schoolwork for a few hours.  

I read this thing once about how the first year of college is important for many reasons, but chief among them is the fact that it’ll be the first time you spend a significant amount of time alone. It totally sucks (don’t get me wrong, I hate it too) but it’s also refreshing getting to know myself and learning to be comfortable with just existing.

Per your question, it's less about *implementing* it here and more that, for the most part, all of the sororities and fraternities are national organizations, with specific chapters at given colleges.   
  
Most of the Greek Letter organizations on campus are social sororities/fraternities. Chi Omega is a national panhellenic sorority (female social fraternity), with UofI hosting the Omicron chapter, while Alpha Sigma Phi is a national interfraternity council fraternity (male social fraternity), with UofI hosting the Eta chapter. Generally, college/university chapters are named in order of the Greek alphabet based on when each chapter of a given frat/sorority was founded, so the chapter at each sorority/frat's founding school is the Alpha chapter.  
  
There are also Black Greek Letter Organizations (ex. Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc., and culturally affiliated fraternities and sororities at Illinois (ex. Alpha Phi Gamma National Sorority Inc. \[Asian affiilated\]).

Not all fraternities and sororities are Greek letter named (ex. the agriculture-focused FarmHouse International Fraternity, with its ""Illinois"" chapter), but most are.

For more info about who/what they are, see this page: [https://fsaffairs.illinois.edu/organizations](https://fsaffairs.illinois.edu/organizations) 

Additionally, there are groups like Alpha Kappa Psi, which is a national business fraternity, and UofI has the Epsilon chapter on campus.  Business fraternities and the like are RSOs, not social fraternities, though they use the same naming convention.  There are also many Greek-letter honor societies like Phi Beta Kappa, which may be discipline specific, or multi-disciplinary, and have varying qualifications for acceptance.",metheglyn,2,so i rabbit holed on this per your question its less about implementing it here and more that for the most part all of the sororities and fraternities are national organizations with specific chapters at given colleges most of the greek letter organizations on campus are social sororitiesfraternities chi omega is a national panhellenic sorority female social fraternity with uofi hosting the omicron chapter while alpha sigma phi is a national interfraternity council fraternity male social fraternity with uofi hosting the eta chapter generally collegeuniversity chapters are named in order of the greek alphabet based on when each chapter of a given fratsorority was founded so the chapter at each sororityfrats founding school is the alpha chapter there are also black greek letter organizations ex alpha kappa alpha sorority inc and culturally affiliated fraternities and sororities at illinois ex alpha phi gamma national sorority inc asian affiilated not all fraternities and sororities are greek letter named ex the agriculturefocused farmhouse international fraternity with its illinois chapter but most are for more info about whowhat they are see this page httpsfsaffairsillinoiseduorganizationshttpsfsaffairsillinoiseduorganizations additionally there are groups like alpha kappa psi which is a national business fraternity and uofi has the epsilon chapter on campus business fraternities and the like are rsos not social fraternities though they use the same naming convention there are also many greekletter honor societies like phi beta kappa which may be discipline specific or multidisciplinary and have varying qualifications for acceptance,NEU,0.9677295684814453

The counseling center’s purpose is to help students, but they can only accommodate a small amount of long term clients due to the size of the student body and the limited amount of counselors they have. They will do a certain number of sessions with you and then try to refer you out to somewhere else in the community. If you are looking to just try therapy short-term for a few sessions, or want help finding other mental health resources in town, it could definitely be useful. But if you are looking for something long term I would research other options. People expect a team of about 20 counselors to be a catch-all solution to the entire breadth of potential mental health issues of 50,000 students, but really they are a crisis management/referral service.

2599,2024-08-27 13:01:58,16,"A course's grade distribution, how much work is required, and how much students learn are essentially independent variables. Any permutation is possible. There are courses that don't teach much, don't expect much of students, but still make sure to curve the course around a low median grade—maybe in hopes of appearing like they are teaching something. There are also well-designed courses where students are appropriately challenged and supported, and where grades reflect what they learn, not adherence to some arbitrary distribution. (This is one of the many reasons why using GPA distribution to determine whether a course is a good one to take is so misguided.)

There are also courses at other universities that operate under the (misguided) assumption that their job is to weed out students. Unfortunately, those courses tend not to be very good at actually teaching the material, and end up really only selecting for students who already know it. This is something we try to be very careful about early in our CS program, since we have many students who enter with various amounts of prior experience.

Our goal throughout the early computer science sequence is for our courses to teach an appropriate amount of material and to give every student a chance to succeed. Yes: Students have to put in the work. That's a hard requirement. And no, we're not chasing high success rates by dumbing down the material or making our courses not appropriately challenging—our early courses are generally hitting their marks in terms of moving students forward, and cover content comparable with other top programs.

So initially you are required to take MSE 396 which is this 3 credit hour course which introduces you to technical writing, lab safety, etc. Then you take MSE 397 for every semester you do research which is 1 credit hour but really is a placeholder for however many hours you want to do your research. I'm pretty sure you do the MSE 396 course if you are planning to do research with a professor who is a part of the MatSE department itself.

If you're looking to browse, it's a little more challenging in a huge university library than at a bookstore or local library, but it can be done! The Main Stacks and the Literature and Languages Library are your best bets. 

In the Library of Congress system, works of British literature are catalogued as PR (followed by a bunch of numbers) and works of US literature are catalogued as PS (followed by a bunch of numbers). Within those categories, books are arranged by broad chronological order, so the smallest numbers are generally works of or pertaining to the earliest literary periods, and the larger numbers are the most recent. Within each time period, the books are arranged by author's last name. If you go to the actual library and find a map with all the locations of the Library of Congress numbers, you can usually find the vast array of shelves that have books you'd want to read. It's still going to be challenging because works of scholarship and analysis are mixed in with the fiction (e.g., you'll find all the books written ABOUT Toni Morrison and her novels alongside Sula, Beloved, Song of Solomon, etc.), but once you figure the pattern out, it gets easier to skim the shelves.

A simple strategy is to think of a book that you've already read or are curious about), look it up in the catalog to get the LC number for it, and then go to that section of the library, where you'll find other books from the roughly the same period. (Particularly useful if you're interested in novels from non-US/non-British authors, or if you want to explore memoirs, literary nonfiction, and the like).

2977,2024-08-26 07:49:26,64,"Gonna throw my hat into the ring here because this topic has always been interesting (and a bit frustrating, at the fault of nobody in particular) to me as a lead in both an engineering org targeted at women and an ACM SIG lead (obligatory disclaimer my opinions do not reflect my RSOs opinions, I’m speaking as an individual, etc). Women’s orgs (and orgs associated with industry minorities generally speaking, though I can only personally speak for women’s orgs) inherently have a harder job to do with less resources than the average engineering RSO, and I don’t necessarily think it’s fair to expect the same level of depth from them. Let me explain what I mean.

Let’s say the average freshman CS major can join one professional RSO before going crazy. To simplify, we’re gonna say that freshman CS majors can pick between ACM and WCS. ACM is targeted at all genders but in practice is male dominated, and WCS is mostly targeted at women and gender minorities. Let’s say that there are 600 men and 300 women in the incoming freshman CS class. Nearly 100% of freshman men in CS will pick ACM because they don’t necessarily need to seek out their gender to find it in this industry. Let’s say 2/3 of freshman women in CS join WCS and 1/3 join ACM. There are now 700 freshman in ACM and 200 freshman in WCS. As someone who has seen the internals of how clubs get funding, I can tell you both from a sponsorship standpoint and how SODA allocates funds that more attendance means more leverage for financial support. WCS’s job is to do what ACM does with much less people and less funding and *also* to build a strong support system for women in the field while trying to retain a much higher percentage of people to stay afloat (which explains why you tend to see a lot more socials, office hours, etc). In my opinion, this is basically an impossible task. I don’t really have a good, streamlined solution to problems like this, I’ve spent a notable amount of my undergraduate career trying to find just that. That being said, in the meantime I’ve learned to get what I can reasonably expect to get out of women’s engineering RSOs, and looking back I wish I’d gotten more involved with them sooner. 

I will also say as a final note that I can’t speak for your individual experience on this (or WECE as an org), but in terms of discourse or drama, the grass is not always greener on the other side. I love both my RSOs and generally have no issues with them but the closer you get to the top of clubs like this, the more hard directional choices you have to make, the more you see go down, the more time you see wasted on stuff that doesn’t matter, etc. Regardless of the breadth of shenanigans I’ve seen over time, I wouldn’t trade the effort I’ve put into either of them for the world.",lukewarmdaisies,41,gonna throw my hat into the ring here because this topic has always been interesting and a bit frustrating at the fault of nobody in particular to me as a lead in both an engineering org targeted at women and an acm sig lead obligatory disclaimer my opinions do not reflect my rsos opinions im speaking as an individual etc womens orgs and orgs associated with industry minorities generally speaking though i can only personally speak for womens orgs inherently have a harder job to do with less resources than the average engineering rso and i dont necessarily think its fair to expect the same level of depth from them let me explain what i mean lets say the average freshman cs major can join one professional rso before going crazy to simplify were gonna say that freshman cs majors can pick between acm and wcs acm is targeted at all genders but in practice is male dominated and wcs is mostly targeted at women and gender minorities lets say that there are  men and  women in the incoming freshman cs class nearly  of freshman men in cs will pick acm because they dont necessarily need to seek out their gender to find it in this industry lets say  of freshman women in cs join wcs and  join acm there are now  freshman in acm and  freshman in wcs as someone who has seen the internals of how clubs get funding i can tell you both from a sponsorship standpoint and how soda allocates funds that more attendance means more leverage for financial support wcss job is to do what acm does with much less people and less funding and also to build a strong support system for women in the field while trying to retain a much higher percentage of people to stay afloat which explains why you tend to see a lot more socials office hours etc in my opinion this is basically an impossible task i dont really have a good streamlined solution to problems like this ive spent a notable amount of my undergraduate career trying to find just that that being said in the meantime ive learned to get what i can reasonably expect to get out of womens engineering rsos and looking back i wish id gotten more involved with them sooner i will also say as a final note that i cant speak for your individual experience on this or wece as an org but in terms of discourse or drama the grass is not always greener on the other side i love both my rsos and generally have no issues with them but the closer you get to the top of clubs like this the more hard directional choices you have to make the more you see go down the more time you see wasted on stuff that doesnt matter etc regardless of the breadth of shenanigans ive seen over time i wouldnt trade the effort ive put into either of them for the world,NEU,0.7204078435897827

I did CS at first, but transferred to ECE, when I realized there were too many bootcamp/self taughts going for entry-level software jobs.  
There are way more software jobs than hardware, BUT there are also way more people applying for those jobs.  
With an ECE degree, as long as you pick the right electives such as the class where you build an OS, you should still know the main fundamentals of a CS degree.

Ask your self:  
What do I want to do after college:  
1. Build the newest computer components, where you need to do math, physics, and machine code and simple algorithms (mainly divide and conquer)  
2. Build complex software, that requires planning, reading, a little bit of math (or sometimes a lot of math), and logic and simple algorithms (mainly divide and conquer and sorting)  
3. Build simple software that requires very complex math and algorithms to find patterns from data sets  
4. I dont know yet  


If you chose:  
1. Go with ECE  
2. Go with CS  
3. Go with Math or Stats + CS  
4. Go with ECE. you still get more than enough knowledge of CS to work a purely software job, and enough math to get a data engineering/scientists job IF you really practice your diff eqs/linear algebra/algorithms.

A young lady that was decently dressed (didnt look homeless or anything) came up to me saying she needed money because her car got towed. She asked me for $300 (towing fee and a ride to the lot). I believed her because that's how much I paid when my car got towed. We went to a nearby ATM and before I gave her the money she wrote me a check. Little did I know, that you could verify if a check is valid or if the amount on the check would bounce just by calling the customer service number on the back of the check. I accepted the check and went on the train home. I knew in my gut something was wrong and that the check was fake, but I decided to ignore my gut feeling because I really wanted to help her out and even if I was getting scammed, I was fine with losing the $300, because I was going to make a lot more the next morning because I had a hobby that was paying well at the time.

 Definitely read the syllabus and go back to it if you have questions about the class (grading, due dates, etc.). It will have most of the information you need about the course and Dr. Marville and your TA will get exhausted from students asking questions that can be in the syllabus. 



There is extra credit you can get but you have to complete the assignment fairly early in the semester. I would take advantage of this while you can even if you think you might be okay. It is a good opportunity to boost your grade. 


Use the chemistry learning center (CLC) and your TA for help. If you don't like your particular TA, other TAs can help you in the CLC. 


Discussion sections are not optional (at least not for this particular professor) and you will have clicker questions to answer each class period.

The best part about going away to college is that no one here knows that you’re an introvert… so you can stop doing that without people who have known you for years thinking “*what’s going on there?*”

Plus, pretty much everyone in college is the same boat to some extent, so you only need to make even the slightest effort to bridge the gap between you and someone who might end up being your best friend for life.  

You don’t need to become some super-extrovert, just make the slightest effort…
- Introduce yourself to everyone on your floor, in your classes, labs, etc.
- Go to every dorm/hall social thing.
- Go to every event during welcome week.
- Keep your dorm room door open when you’re in your room the first few weeks, and say “hi” to everyone who walks by.

are you involved with any of the cultural houses on campus?  I’ve heard good things from people who connect over shared experiences and food.   


Do you attended music and other performing arts (dance, theater, etc) events? Most campus based performances are under 10 dollars - many are free or just 2 or 3 dollars. I’ve found i see some of the same folks attending performances around a genre - many are not students currently or never were. So the age range might be good for you to make connections.
